Tutorials on how to mod Beat Saber on quest!


# Requirements

A Oculus Quest\
A USB-C cord to USB-A(or you can use WiFi mode, not recommended and not guaranteed to work!)\
An Oculus Account\
A VALID copy of BeatSaber.\
A computer\


# Step 1: Setup your Quest for developmen

Login to your Oculus Account and goto dashboard.oculus.com\
If you do not have a organazation, it will prompt you to create one. If not, you should be good. Raise an issue for more help\
Accept the terms and whip out your device you use to manage Oculus Quest(download the Oculus App from the app store if you do not have it)\
Head to Settings section, select your quest, click "More settings", and enable Developer Mode. Reboot your quest after.\
Now, enter your settings section on the Quest, and choose General and turn on Unknown Sources. If you got that, great! If not, raise an issue so it bugs me to update the guide!\
You are now finished and can proceed!

# Step 2: Setup your PC for installing BMBF/BeatOn

## IF SIDEQUEST DOES NOT WORK, SCROLL DOWN ON THIS GUIDE UNTIL YOU GET TO ADB INSTALL SECTION

Head onto your PC, and download SideQuest.\
Connect your Oculus Quest through USB.\
Wireless users:  Choose the WiFi icon at the very top and hit enable.\
Go on to your Quest, and a message showing: 'Trust this computer?' will show up. Click always allow and trust. If it doesn't show, try to repeat Step 1\

Verify this by looking at the top of sidequest, and seeing if it has a green light.\

If so, go on! If not, restart sidequest. If that doesnt work, check the cord. If that also doesn't work, check out the troubleshooting section.\  


# Step 3: Installing BMBF/BeatOn!

Great job making it this far!\
We will be providing both BMBF and BeatOn guides.\


###### I recommend BMBF, as it supports the latest BeatSaber version. BeatOn didn't work for me.



#### Backing Up(Optional, you can just reinstall from store)
On SideQuest, open the apps list.
Find com.beatgames.beatsaber and choose the gear next to it.\
Press "Backup game data". Wait for it to back up Beat Saber, and then scroll down and click "Backup APK file."\

#### To restore:
Repeat the same process without pressing the Backup buttons.\
Scroll to "Apk Backups", and choose the circle next to the date of the backup(it should be under the button)


##### Downloading

For the latest and greatest build for BMBF, download it from here: https://bmbf.dev/nightly \
For the stable build of BeatOn, download it from here: https://github.com/sidequestlegend/BeatOn/releases/tag/latest\
Use SideQuest to get the version of Beat Saber, and download the according BMBF/BeatOn file.\
#### If you can't find the appropriate version, you'll need to downgrade Beat Saber. Follow the guide in the troubleshooting section.
After that's done, extract the contents of the zip into your downloads.\

##### Installing

Make sure SideQuest is started and your Oculus Quest is connected to your PC.\
Drag the APK file you downloaded/extracted onto SideQuest.\
If it fails, check that you have the correct file and that Unknown Sources is enabled. If that does not work, raise an issue or check troubleshooting\
On your quest, navigate to the Library, and on the sidebar choose Unknown Sources. Scroll down until you see BMBF/BeatOn, then open it.\
It will take you to a white/black screen.\
Press the button to start Step 1. It will uninstall BeatSaber.
###### IMPORTANT: Press uninstall when the box appears.
###### To check if uninstall failed, press Step 2 button. It will give message in logs saying "BeatSaber is installed!"

Read the important markings, then continue and press "Patch BeatSaber".\
Let it do its thing, if it gets stuck for more than 5 minutes, check troubleshooting.\
After, read the important messages and choose "Install Beat Saber".\
Choose Install when the box appears, if it pops up saying something about Unknown Sources, choose Settings and scroll down until you see Unknown Sources and check the box.\
This will install "Beat Saber".
## VERY IMPORTANT: Choose done when install finishes!
After installing, it should start BMBF/BeatOn, and you will be in the main menu. You will see BeastSaber.\
Choose "Start Beat Saber" at the top right. If Beat Saber wants access, allow it.

###### If it loads successfully, you have completely installed BMBF/BeatOn! Congrats!
